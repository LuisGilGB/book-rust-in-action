## Serialization and deserialization

Demo: `serde-demo`

How to serialize and deserialize Rust values to/from distinct formats? `serde` crate.

This crate provides the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits.
```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct City {
  name: String,
  population: usize,
  latitude: f64,
  longitude: f64,
}
```

Then, a conversation to JSON can be done this way:
```rust
let merida = City {
  name: String::from("MÃ©rida"),
  //...
}

let as_json = to_json(&merida).unwrap();
```
Other formats: bincode and CBOR (both are non human-readable formats, but more performant than JSON).

## Encoding bytes to UTF-8
`String::from_utf8_lossy()` converts bytes to a string encoded with UTF-8.

## Extracting command line arguments
Demo: `fview`

- Use `std::env::args`
- Extract the nth argument with the `nth` method:
```let arg3 = env::args().nth(3)```
- Use `expect` instead of `unwrap` to be ready against error that may cause a panic: `let file_name = arg3.expect("Error trying to get the file name")`

## File operations in Rust

We use `std::fs::File` as the key library to work with files.

Methods to create a `File` object:
- `File::open` - Returns an `Err` if the file doesn't exist, otherwise, it returns an `Ok(File)` with the file in read-only mode.
- `File::create` - Always returns an `Ok(File)` with an edition cursor available at the beginning of the file.

`std::fs::OpenOptions` is also available for additional control at opening a file. Do we want to enable reading and writing, creating in case of miss and appending the written content next to the old content? This is the way:
```rust
let file = OpenOptions::new()
  .read(true)
  .write(true)
  .create(true)
  .append(true)
  .open(path)?;
```
Notice how the builder pattern is used to set this options before actually opening the file.

To properly work with paths (i.e., to work without having to worry about path separators or other cross-platform concerns), use the libraries `std::path::Path` and `std::path::PathBuf`.
```rust
let hello_address = PathBuf::from("/tmp/hello.txt")
```
These types also offer some utility methods:
```rust
hello_address.extension() // Returns the extension as a Some, Some("txt") following the previous case
```
Beware both types are not guaranteed to be UTF-8 compliant.
